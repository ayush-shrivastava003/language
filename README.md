# language
A simple interpreter built in Python. Just a fun little project to learn how to build interpreters, nothing super crazy. Once I've figured out the essentials, I'll remake it in a faster and stricter language (likely Rust or Java).

Although it does work, the interpreter is insanely slow. You can run `fibonacci.language` to see how long it takes to calculate the Fibonacci Sequence.
